# Charcoal-Engine
Open Source 3D Game Engine coded in C#

To edit, compile, and test the engine, you will ***(as of right now)*** need:

* Visual Studio C# 2010

* Microsoft XNA 4.0

* Microsoft Games for Windows Marketplace

* Microsoft Games for Windows - LIVE Redistributable

Folders:

* Jitter Physics 0.1.7.0 contains the .dll for the physics library
* MapEditor contains simple code to modify the scene while 
            the engine is still running - it is a work in progress
* MJLGameEngine - main code for the rendering engine
* MJLGameEngineContent - contains content files, such as .fx files
* SceneTest - project folder for the project that uses the engine - 
            it is a very basic 'test game' that tests out different
            parts of the engine. Also contains it's own images and 
            3D models that it uses
