# Charcoal-Engine
Open Source 3D Game Engine coded in C#

To edit, compile, and test the engine, you will ***(as of right now)*** need:

* Visual Studio C# 2017
* Monogame Framework

Folders:

* CharcoalEngine - main code for the rendering engine
* SceneTest - project folder for the project that uses the engine - 
            it is a very basic 'test game' that tests out different
            parts of the engine. Also contains it's own images and 
            3D models that it uses
* SimpleEditor - simple scene editor, used to modify 3D scene, manage models & materials, etc.
